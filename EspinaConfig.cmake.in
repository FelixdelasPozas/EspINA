# Find EspINA includes and libraries
#
# Once done, this will define:
# ESPINA_FOUND: EspINA libraries are available
# ESPINA_INCLUDE_DIR: Espina include directories
# ESPINA_USE_FILE: File to compile programs which use EspINA

# Name conventions: Dependencies use plural forms,
# the package itself uses the singular forms defined
# by find_path and find_library
