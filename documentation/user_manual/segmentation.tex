or not.\\

\textbf{Add Taxonomy}: Create a new segmentation at the same level than the
selected one.\\
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/add_child} &
\textbf{Add SubTaxonomy}: Create a new segmentation as a child of the selected
one.\\
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/remove} &
\textbf{Delete Taxonomy}: Delete selected taxonomy.
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\subsection{Segmentation Explorer}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/SegmentationExplorer}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{m{0.8cm} m{13cm}}
 & %No icon
\textbf{Segmentation Information}: Open the segmentation inspectors for the
selected segmentations.\\
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/trash-full} &
\textbf{Delete Segmentation}: Delete selected segmentations.
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\subsubsection{Segmentation Explorer}

Window composed of a 3D window, a filter inspector and a data view for a given
segmentation.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/SegmentationInspector}
\end{center}

For more specific information, please refer to the corresponding section.

\subsection{Volume Of Interest}

Define a volume to limit the effect of other tools.\\

\begin{tabular}{m{0.8cm} m{13cm}}
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/toolbar/voi/rsc/roi} &
\textbf{Rectangular Cuboid}: Define an axis aligned rectangular cuboid as volume
of interest.
 \end{tabular}

\subsection{Seed Grow Segmentation}

This tool provides a semi-automated segmentation algorithm. Select a voxel
belonging to the object being segmented. A new segmentation will be createad
including all voxel which are equivalent (in gray scale values) to the selected
one, the seed.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/SeedGrowSegmentation}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{tabular}{m{0.8cm} m{13cm}}
& %No icon
\textbf{Threshold}: Gray scale difference admisible to consider a voxel equal to
the one selected as seed. \\

& %No icon
\textbf{Default VOI}: Determine whether or not a rectangular volume of interest
centered on the selection point is applied. If you have defined your own volume
of interest, then that is used instead of the default one.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/toolbar/seedgrow/rsc/pixelSelector} &
\textbf{Pixel Selector}: Create a new segmentation using the voxel under the
cursor as seed for the Seed Grow Algorithm.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/toolbar/seedgrow/rsc/bestPixelSelector} &
\textbf{Best Pixel Selector}: Create a new segmentation using the best voxel
,within the neighborhood of the voxel under the cursor, as seed for the Seed
Grow Algorithm. Best voxel is defined in terms of gray scale similarity with a
reference gray scale value. The reference value can be configured at Seed Grow
Segmentation settings panel.
\end{tabular}

Tip: Use Ctrl+Wheel to change threshold while any selector is active.

\subsubsection{Filter Inspector}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/SeedGrowSegmentationFilterInspector}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\subsection{Edition Tools}
To start creating a new segmentation select your tool and then with no other
segmentation being selected, start drawing on the 2D views.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig/EditorToolbar}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.3cm}

Brush tools will behave different depending on whether there is a selected
segmentation or not. If there is only one segmentation selected then
drawing/erasing will modify it. Otherwise, a new segmentation will be created
until the tool is deactivated. \\

Tip: As a visual help, the brush border color will change from blue (creating a
new segmentation) to green (editing current segmentation).

\begin{tabular}{m{0.8cm} m{13cm}}
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/pencil2D} &
\textbf{2D Brush}: Use a circle to draw on current slice. Use Ctrl+Wheel to
change brush radius.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/pencil3D} &
\textbf{3D Brush}: Use a sphere to draw on current and adjacent slices. Use
Ctrl+Wheel to change brush radius.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/lasso} &
\textbf{Contour}: Use a free-form contour to draw on current slice.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/eraser} &
\textbf{Eraser}: Ctrl click while using any of the previous tools to erase
instead of draw.
\end{tabular}

Sometimes, it can be convenient to use different tools to segement different
parts of the same segmentation and then combine the to create the segmentation.

\begin{tabular}{m{0.8cm} m{13cm}}
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/add} &
\textbf{Combine}: Create a unique segmentation using all voxels from all
selected segmentations.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/remove} &
\textbf{Substract}: Use the first selected input as final segmentation and erase
all voxels which belong to any of the rest of the segmentations.
\end{tabular}

\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/erode} &
\textbf{Erode}: Apply Morphological Erode\\
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/dilate} &
\textbf{Dilate}: Apply Morphological Dilate\\
\includegraphics[width=0.7cm]{../../frontend/rsc/open} &
